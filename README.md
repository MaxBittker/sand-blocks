# Sandspiel Studio
**Sandspiel Studio** is a new tool for creating and sharing new Sandspiel elements. It uses a block-based system to let beginners (and pros) create their own simulations.

When it's ready for release, the tool will be free, but right now we're looking for some kind people to support our development process and give us feedback.

So if you're interested in supporting the project and getting behind-the-scenes updates, [**sign up**](https://sandspiel.gumroad.com/l/studio-early-access) for our private discord!
